# SCSS Wild Code School

In order to add more style to the site findThePrecious, Sauron wants you to add some rings, big, small, and with many different colors!

Using SCSS, you'll need to create a mixin called ring that draws a ring.

Hint: a ring is nothing more than a square with a great border-radius, without a background color and with a rather wide border.

This mixin must allow you to:

•
Choose a size and a color for the ring

•
Add a colored shadow (depending on the size and color chosen)

•
Edit the thickness of the ring using a function that takes in the chosen size

Once the mixin has been created, make a simple HTML page containing the rings, called index.html, matching it to the image below.

Hint: Use a for loop in SCSS to display the succession of 6 nested horizontal rings, incrementing their size each time.
